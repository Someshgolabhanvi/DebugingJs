# Execution context has two environment one is variable environment and another one is Thread of execution
# JS is Synchronous single threaded language
# Execution context is created in two phases first one is memory creation phase  and second one is code execution phase

# To handle everything JS has it's own call stack

# Globle Execution context

# Call Stack Maintains the order of execution of execution context

# Hoisting in JS -> Hoisting is a phenomenon in JS by which we access variable and function even before we initialize it

# window and this  || this === window 
# undefined and not defined
